This workflow is described as the "Centralized Workflow" at the following link:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows

# Initial Setup
# =============
#
# The following should be done once if you have not already created a local copy 
# of the Steamworks2017 development repo
#
#>cd to your workspece folder
# execute the following git commands

>git clone https://github.com/Team5519/Steamworks2017.git

# In Eclipse do the following to add the Steamworks2017 project
# File >> Import... >> Existing Projects Into Workspace...


# Making, Commiting, and Pushing Changes
# ======================================
#
# For every coding session follow this workflow to make sure that your local 
# copy of the development repo staus in close sync with the master repo on GetHub.
# Rememmber that if many team memebrs are coding at the same time then your local 
# repo copy will be slughtly different until it is pushed up to the master copy.

# Make sure you start in sync with the master
>git pull
>git status

# Make some changes -- Repeat these commands after every logical grouping of changes
>git add -A
>git commit -m 'Comment'

# At the end of your coding session -- After adding and commiting changes
>git push origin master


# Managing Conflicts
# ==================
#
# If your local copy is badly out of sync with the master repo then you will get 
# error messages when you try to "push" your changes. Follow these steps to fix the 
# conflicts in your local copy so that you can safely merge them with the master repo.

>git pull --rebase origin master

# Git will begin merging your changes and when it encounters a problem it will
# issue a CONFLICT message and pause the merge. You need to fix the file(s) and restart 
# the merge as follows:
>git status
# Use Eclipse to edit and fix the files reported in the status output
>git add <fixed-files>
>git rebase --continue
# When the rebase completes
>git push origin master

# If you cannot resolve the conflicts and need to abort
>git rebase --abort
